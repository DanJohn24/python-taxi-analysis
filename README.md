## NYC Taxi Data Analysis

This Python script analyzes New York City taxi trip data stored in CSV files. It performs the following tasks:

- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Loads multiple CSV files, filters data based on defined criteria, and concatenates them into a single DataFrame.
- **Statistics**: Calculates total fare amount, average fare amount, average trip distance, and total number of rides.
- **Grahps**: Analyzes the distribution of pickups by hour and visualizes it using a horizontal bar chart.
- **Payment Type Analysis**: Categorizes payment types and plots their distribution using a pie chart.
- **Location Analysis**: Maps pickup and drop-off locations to boroughs in NYC, counts occurrences, and visualizes them using pie charts.

The script utilizes Jupyter Notebook, Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for data visualization, and Glob for file handling.
